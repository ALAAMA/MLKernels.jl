Machine Learning Kernels
========================

`MLKernels.jl`_ is a Julia package for kernel functions (or covariance functions in Gaussian 
processes) that are used in the kernel methods of machine learning. The goal is to provide a Julia
datatype for machine learning kernels and an efficient set of methods to calculate or approximate 
kernel matrices. The package has no dependencies beyond base Julia.
