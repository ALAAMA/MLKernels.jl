========================
Machine Learning Kernels
========================

`MLKernels.jl`_ is a Julia package for Mercer kernel functions (or the 
covariance functions of Gaussian processes) that are used in the kernel 
methods of machine learning. This package provides a flexible datatype for 
representing and constructing machine learning kernels as well as an efficient 
set of methods to compute or approximate kernel matrices. The package has no 
dependencies beyond base Julia.
